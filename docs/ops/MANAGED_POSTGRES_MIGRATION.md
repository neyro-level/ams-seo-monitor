# Managed PostgreSQL Migration

Status: completed on `2026-09-11`.

Production was moved after the explicit owner command. This document now records the active contract and rollback boundary; it is not authorization for another infrastructure change.

## Required topology

- Timeweb Managed PostgreSQL 18 in the same Moscow private network as the application server;
- no public database endpoint;
- TLS-required connection from the application server over the private BGP address;
- separate login credentials for `ams_web`, `ams_worker`, `ams_migrator` and `ams_backup`;
- credentials separated in root-owned production env files; rotated replacements must also be synchronized to the project Doppler scope through a write-capable identity.

`ams_web` and `ams_worker` are `NOBYPASSRLS` runtime roles. `ams_migrator` owns schema changes but is never used by the application. Timeweb Managed PostgreSQL does not currently allow the project administrator to grant `BYPASSRLS`; therefore provider physical backups are the complete recovery source after `FORCE RLS` is enabled. The independent logical S3 backup has a fail-closed RLS preflight and must never publish a partial dump.

With `BACKUP_STRATEGY=provider-physical`, deployment requires a root-owned proof file for a Timeweb backup created within the previous two hours and disables the logical backup timer. A missing or stale proof stops release before migrations.

## Completed proof

1. Fresh source backup, checksum and isolated restore smoke passed.
2. Four provider-managed login identities were created and least-privilege DML/DDL checks passed.
3. Current immutable production image completed migrations and live/ready smoke against the target.
4. Final write freeze and restore completed; exact row counts matched for all 55 persistent tables.
5. Web and worker returned healthy status after the switch; PostgreSQL, auth, outbox, worker heartbeat and integration freshness were ready.
6. A post-cutover logical dump, checksum and private S3 upload passed.
7. The previous local database is read-only with zero application connections and retained through `2026-09-25`.

The product RLS authorization matrix remains part of the unmerged access-control release gate. It was not applied to the current production schema during this infrastructure-only cutover.

## Hard stops

- Do not grant `BYPASSRLS` or table ownership to web/worker logins.
- Do not activate runtime group roles until every request/job opens a transaction and sets its verified authorization context.
- Do not expose the managed database through a public IP.
- Do not treat a successful dump as recovery proof; restore and row-count checks are mandatory.
