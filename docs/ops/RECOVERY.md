# RECOVERY

Recovery has two independent contours:

1. code/runtime rollback;
2. PostgreSQL data recovery.

Code rollback does not roll back schema/data. DB restore is not an automatic release rollback.

## Runtime Rollback

Automatic post-switch rollback in `scripts/deploy-production.mjs` restores:

- previous `current` symlink;
- previous Nginx/systemd assets;
- previous `shared/release.env`;
- previous web/worker runtime.

It does not delete failed release automatically and does not change PostgreSQL data.

Manual rollback requires:

- exact current SHA;
- exact previous SHA;
- release health DTO;
- service states;
- proof that previous code is compatible with already applied schema.

## Database Recovery

Production backup contract:

- custom-format `pg_dump`;
- checksum;
- private offsite copy;
- remote HEAD confirmation before retention;
- 7 daily / 8 weekly / 6 monthly;
- credentials outside Git/logs/docs.

Restore procedure:

1. choose verified dump/checksum;
2. resolve `latest.dump` to exact immutable file;
3. mount it read-only;
4. restore into temporary PostgreSQL database;
5. verify owner, migrations and key row counts;
6. verify application compatibility;
7. request separate owner decision before production restore.

`ops/postgres/restore-smoke.sh` must never restore over production.

## Failure Classes

- Web release failure: rollback code/assets only.
- Migration failure before cutover: stop; fix with new reviewed migration, never edit applied migration.
- Worker provider failure: keep honest SourceRun/ReportSnapshot state; no DB restore.
- Outbox failure: inspect PENDING/PROCESSING/DEAD_LETTER and retry only after root-cause correction.
- Data corruption/loss: stop writes, preserve evidence, verify offsite dump in temp DB, request owner decision.
- Secret compromise: follow [`TOKEN_ROTATION.md`](TOKEN_ROTATION.md).

## Required Evidence

- current and rollback SHA;
- migration state;
- health/auth/tenant smoke;
- worker status and timestamps;
- backup checksum and offsite confirmation;
- temporary restore row-count checks;
- incident timeline without secrets/PII.
